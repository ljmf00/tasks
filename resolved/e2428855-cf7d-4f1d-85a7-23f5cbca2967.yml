  Hi D community!

  I'm here again, to describe what I've done during the tenth week of Symmetry
  Autumn of Code.

  ## LLVM upstream follow up update

  During the discussion for the next patch in the train, 4 more patches have been
  raised, due to request to split it even more:

  - https://reviews.llvm.org/D114305
  - https://reviews.llvm.org/D114307
  - https://reviews.llvm.org/D114308
  - https://reviews.llvm.org/D114309

  Some more changes were made on other existing patches due to further discussion
  on implementation details.

  ## Minimal TypeSystem for D

  This week I finally focused on getting a minimal TypeSystem working for D on
  the LLDB. This means nothing to the end user and huge change need to be made to
  make it functional exactly the same as is right now, the main difference is
  that, instead of relying on Clang type system, we have our own.

  For now it has the Clang type system disabled and detects D as usual, but does
  nothing, when requesting any type information.

  The current changes for the implementation of D TypeSystem will be in
  [this](https://github.com/ljmf00/lldb-d/pull/1) PR.

  I decided to create a seperate repository for this until I have a decent plugin
  to upstream. As this might take a while to implement, I would like to ask the
  community if it is worth to do some builds to several platforms with the
  demangling and language formatters enabled? I'm particularly asking this since
  building LLVM is a beefy task and some may not be able to do it easily with
  their machine. What is your thoughts?

  ## What is next?

  I will continue implementing TypeSystem for D as well as a new type wrapper to
  represent a D type. I'm going to start adding support for very basic types.
