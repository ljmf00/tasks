summary: Write to the mailing list about the D plugin
notes: |
  Hi llvm-dev,

  I'm writing here to discuss the addition of D language plugin to LLDB.
  Following the issue #52223 from Bugzilla, we are currently using C/C++ language
  plugin for D. This project is part of the Symmetry Autumn of Code 2021, which
  proposes to implement better integration for D into LLDB.

  This project is a highly requested feature for D developers who use Apple-based
  devices since configuring GDB requires extra configuration and self signing
  binaries.

  One possible solution is to write a plugin using the Python public API,
  although it has some limitations, since, AFAIK, custom expressions are not
  currently well supported.

  More context about the project milestones can be found
  [here](lsferreira.net/public/assets/posts/d-saoc-2021-01/milestones.md).

  I would like to discuss the possibility of upstreaming the plugin in C++ to the
  official tree and if there is anything in the roadmap to support custom
  expressions via Python.
