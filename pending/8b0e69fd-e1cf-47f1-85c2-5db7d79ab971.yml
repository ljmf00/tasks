summary: Write to https://github.com/dlang/dub/issues/1245
notes: |
  I have very strong opinions about this and we should discuss this carefully.

  I don't think this should be implemented at all. Let's please not follow other
  package managers just because they do the same.

  Lockfiles serves a clear purpose, reproduce an environment. Encouraging someone
  to not use them, in libraries, leads to a lot of issues being created to
  intentionally remove lock files, making people confuse about the purpose of it.
  On libraries we should both test in a locked and a suitable different
  environment (more commonly the latest, but supposedly any supported version,
  according to the specified version range).
