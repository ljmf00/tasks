summary: Send message to lldb-dev to add more options to buildbots
notes: |
  Hi lldb-dev,

  I'm CC'ing the LLDB buildbot owners, in case they are not subscribed to lldb-dev
  and writing here in case there is any external buildbot.

  I have a few questions about buildbots, in particular with LLDB buildbots.
