  Hi Chris,

  Thanks for reaching out to me about the D111414 patch.

  I would like to note a few things about this change. This particular patch is
  trivial and required significant changes to conform with the LLVM code style
  and internal APIs.

  Considering the logic is the same compared to the D ABI official specification
  (https://dlang.org/spec/abi.html) I think particularly this patch can be
  merged, although I understand that other changes can be seen differently and
  debatable. And I mean debatable because the current GNU implementation just
  follows the specification and deviating from that logic is quite hard.

  I want to note that I'm currently working on an official refactor of the D
  demangler, so I can perfectly write a clean room implementation if any other
  possibility is not accepted. As you probably understand, the rationale behind
  it is because it is time consuming writing a whole new implementation and
  reusing one is highly desirable.

  As I mentioned in D110576, Iain is the major contributor to this code and
  according to
  https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Legally-Significant.html#Legally-Significant
  a significant number of changes I mentioned are not eligible. Iain also wrote
  in the mentioned patch that agrees with the relicensing. The relicensing is
  possible whenever the original author sees fit.

  If this is not sufficient I can try contacting every contributor and ask for
  permission to relicense the code to LLVM.

  Since I'm not a lawyer, keep in mind to not take any legal advice from me.
