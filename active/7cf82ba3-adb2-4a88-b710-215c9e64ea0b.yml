summary: investigate compiler-specific DWARF generation
notes: |
  # DWARF Generation on D compilers

  - DMD lacks information about `DW_AT_decl_file`, `DW_AT_decl_line` and
    `DW_AT_decl_column` on some tags.
  - LDC lacks information about `DW_AT_decl_column`.
  - LDC generates artificial DWARF variables and don't properly mark then as
    `DW_AT_artificial`.

  ## Types

  - GDC produces an error on LLDB:
    ```
    error: need to add support for DW_TAG_base_type 'dchar' encoded with DW_ATE = 0x8, bit_size = 32
    ```

  ## Enumerations

  - DMD has a bug with `DW_TAG_enumerator`. Currently that information is not
    being generated.

  ## Arrays

  - No D compiler generates correct DWARF tags to represent dynamic arrays. They
    should use `DW_TAG_array_type` with `DW_TAG_subrange_type` and reference the
    size of it using `DW_AT_count`/`DW_AT_upper_bound` variable address or
    manually dereference a stack register, containing the size. This approach is
    used by C compilers when dealing with VLAs.

  ### Normal Arrays

  - Every D compiler except DMD handles normal array type names with fully
    qualified names. I already pushed a fix to this.
  - Every D compiler writes array DWARF information as a struct with length and
    ptr fields.

  - No D compiler generates special DWARF tags when dealing with string arrays.

  ### Associative Arrays

  - DMD has a bug for associative arrays with array types, reporting the wrong
    type in the name.

    For an `int[string]` it reports `_AArray_ucent_int` For an `string[int]` it
    reports `_AArray_int_ucent`

  - Every D compiler except DMD handles associative array types with fully
    qualified names.

  - Associative array struct is not accessible on any D compiler

  ### Interfaces

  - GDC uses `DW_TAG_interface_type` tags including `DW_AT_containing_type`
    pointing to themselves as part of GNU extensions to DWARF, triggering an
    error on LLDB. This tag is not part of the DWARF structure for interfaces.
